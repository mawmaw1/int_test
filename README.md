### Integration Testing

#### This test is testing the integration of a MongoDB with a module. The project that is being tested can be found at https://github.com/mawmaw1/Database_Ass_2.

I am using the "Big Bang" method, where everything is tested at once, since the project is small-scale.

#### Test Case
